Things we haven't included even partially yet!

We should have getAll method  in each class except User Class without any arguments to get everything
We should associate other classes objects in the models of PaperDAO and UserDAO as they are linked to child classes
Exception Handling in every method
Authorization for some methods
Delete for authorized users

Stories:
1) admin should be able to see all users -- getAllUsers(), getUser()
2) admin should be able to delete users -- deleteUsers()
3) admin should be able to add users -- DISCARDED
4) new user can add himself -- setProfile()
5) reset password
6) set my password
7) delete user/users account -- Story 2
8) admin can update user's role. -- makeUserAdmin(), changeAdminStatus(adminID, userId, adminStatus(1,0))
9) admin should be able to update affiliations -- add/Delete/Edit affiliationName , (adminID, affiliId, affilName)
ADD - adminID, affiliNAME | DELETE - adminID, afiliID (CHANGE USER TO NULL) | EDIT - adminID, affiliName
10) user can update his affiliation -- setProfile()
11) admin can update user's review status -- updateCanReview(adminId, userId, canReivewStatus)
13) admin can update any of the user's info -- setProfile() // checkAdmin included
14) email needs to be sent out for reset password -- tomorrow
15) user can add papers
16) user can update his own paper's properties
17) user can update/add/delete his own paper's subjects
18) user can update his paper type
19) user can delete his paper's properties (We need to set them to null if he does so)
20) PaperAuthors can be updated by paper submitter

23) reviewing papers after submission functionality needs to be built for papers and admin can allocate that!
    (NOT NECESSARY TO BUILD)

24) Remember to associate authorization in a clean way for each task -- done .. keep doing
25) We should associate other classes objects in the models of PaperDAO and UserDAO as they are linked to child classes,
this will make some tasks easy if we have the Paper/User Object in Hand!
For Eg - UserModel can have AffiliationObject inside it rather than just affiliation id. We will have to write second query in get method to achieve this.
Another Eg - We should store ArrayList<PaperSubjects> in Papers
ArrayList<PaperAuthors> in both users and papers.
We can store Type Instance in Papers rather than just submissionType

To note : The functions like getType for PaperId have still been built. But it's good to have vice-versa.

26) make login and registration with salting and not directly. --
